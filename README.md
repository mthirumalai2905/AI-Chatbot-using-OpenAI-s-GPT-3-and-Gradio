**AI Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 and Gradio**
This is a simple chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user inputs. The chatbot is built using Gradio to create the user interface.

**Requirements**
To run this chatbot, you will need:

Python 3.x
An OpenAI API key
The openai and gradio Python modules

**Installation**
Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required Python modules by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable with the name OPENAI_API_KEY
Run the chatbot.py file to launch the chatbot interface

**Usage**
Once you have installed the required modules and set your API key, you can run the bot.py file to launch the chatbot interface. 
The interface will allow you to type messages to the chatbot, and the chatbot will respond with messages generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

**Customization**
You can customize the chatbot by modifying the chatbot.py file. For example, you can change the prompts and messages that the chatbot uses, modify the interface design, or add additional functionality to the chatbot.
